This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, implemented primarily in C++ and Python. Each solution includes the problem description, approach, and optimized code to help understand the problem-solving process. The goal is to document my journey in tackling algorithmic challenges and improving problem-solving skills.

Repository Structure

Solutions: Each problem has its own file or directory, named by LeetCode problem number and title (e.g., 289_Game_of_Life.cpp).

Languages: Primarily C++, Java and Python.

Documentation: Brief notes on the problem, approach, time/space complexity, and any key insights.

How to Use

Navigate to a problemâ€™s file to view the code and comments.

Each solution is tested on LeetCode for correctness.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute!

Goals

Solve a variety of LeetCode problems across difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

Optimize solutions for time and space complexity.

Share clear, well-documented code for learning and collaboration.
